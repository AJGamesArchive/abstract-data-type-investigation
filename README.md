# Abstract Data Type Investigation

A Uni assignment to test and investigate the speeds at which Arrays & Linked Lists (ADTs) can handle and process data. 

The aim was to work out which abstract data type would be best suited for the implementation of a 'player health monitor'' system in the enviroment of an online MMO game where performence is highly impartant and networking latency poses a significant consistent challenge.

The investigation then looked at different sorting and searching algorithms that could help speed up the performence of the better performing ADT.
